              <div class="paragraph-1"><p class="intro" style="color: white;">I was hired by Culture Rising, a brick and mortar Cannabis culture store to design, develop and transition their business to Shopify. I designed and developed their theme from scratch, which I'll get into detailsbelow.</p>

                <p class="problem-para">Lack of web presence. </p>
                
                <p class="main-content-2"> 
               Culture Rising has been a brick and mortar Cannabis Culture store operating since 2006. Most of their clientelle was developed through word of mouth, which proved to work for them as they expanded in the upcoming years to four stores. However, with recent legalization of Marijuana in Canada, the Cannabis market has allowed for companies to expand promising growth and new entrepreuneurial oppurutnities. The one thing Culture Rising was missing was a web presence and reaching potnetially new customers world wide.
                </p>
                 <p class="main-content-2"> 
                 I started the project through working closely with the store owners to understand their goals and objectives as a business and how my services could aid them with their business. I provided market research, the struggles of running an eCommerce platoform to the benefits and how it can benefit their company. The main issue they were having was having an organized theme for their large inventory, and I was there to provide them with the right design solutions. 
                 </p> 
                
                <p class="main-content-2"> 
                        The challenge with this project was having a way to syncornize a large inventory, that varied between their stores and how to organize their products in a way that is easy to navigate for the user, without feeling overwhelemed. After a month of research, content and project management it was time for the development phase of their custom theme.

              <div class="container-about" style="padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 100px;">
            <div class="row">
                <h6 style="color: white; font-size: 14px; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 40px;">MY APPROACH?</h6>
                <p class="problem-para">To design a simple yet functional digital experience  </p>
                
                <p class="main-content-2" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"> 
                  After the initial research phase, I managed and organized their inventory on am excel sheet that had all keywords, tags and descriptions, so when it came to upload the products through Shopify's admin panel, all the information would already be completed. Once this was complete, I designed wireframes and mockups in Illustrator and Photoshop for my clients approval to ensure that they were happy with my color palette and design choice.
                </p>
                
                   <p class="main-content-2"> 
                    This theme was designed entirely from scratch, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with integrating Shopify's templating language Liquid and Schema. This was to ensure that once I have handed over the deliverables, any employee at the locations would be able to make customizations such as changing banners, headers and text.
                    </p>
                
                 <p class="main-content-2"> 
                    A challenge I faced was how could I program the theme so that when new inventory is updated, how it would be organized and appear in the stores product catalogue. It occured to me that with some simple JavaScript and Liquid, I was able to create a product catalogue that would update automatically and be organized by brand, vendor or collection based on the tags inputed through the admin panel. Once this was completed, all that was left was some user testing and the theme was ready to be passed off for completion.

                <p style="color: white; font-size: 40px; font-weight: 600; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 40px;">A fun and challenging experience.  </p>
                
                <p class="main-content-2" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"> 
                  This was one of my first major projects and there was a massive learning curve and lots of challenges that I did not expect. Essentially, I had to learn a whole new programming language within the proposed timeline and budget, and make sure it functions properly. There were moments where it seemed like what I was trying to do was impossible, but with some determination and thinking outside the box, I was able to overcome any hurdle that came my way. 
                </p>
                
                   <p class="main-content-2"> 
                  I think after this project, dealing with a small franchise with an extremely large inventory that differs between stores has given me the confidence to tackle any project. I think having a strong background in retail management has helped me understand how retail stores operate on a day to day basis, and how to transition to an eCommerce platform seamlessly. 
                    </p>
                
                 <p class="main-content-2"> 
                Overall, I'm happy with how this project turned out and I'm hoping to work with a diverse group of businesses and clients in the near future!
